# 🦅 Vultr Infrastructure: SentimentSense

SentimentSense leverages the Gemini API and Vultr’s high-performance infrastructure to solve the **Zero-Latency Privacy Gap** in assistive AI.

## 🚀 The Infrastructure Story

Assistive communication tools fail if they are slow. By deploying on Vultr, we eliminate the "infrastructure bottleneck."

### 1. High-Performance Cloud Compute
Our FastAPI backend is containerized and optimized for **Vultr Cloud Compute**.
- **The Win**: Sub-500ms social forensics. For a user with social anxiety or autism, "waiting for the AI" is as stressful as the ambiguity itself. Vultr's optimized vCPUs make the "Psychological Prosthetic" feel instantaneous.

### 2. Vultr Cloud GPU (The Privacy Play)
Neurodivergent users often share deeply personal, vulnerable messages. 
- **The Future**: Our architecture is designed to toggle from Gemini SaaS to a **Self-Hosted Llama-3-70B** running on **Vultr Cloud GPUs** (NVIDIA A100/H100).
- **The Win**: Full data sovereignty. Your private social life never leaves your Vultr instance.

### 3. Vultr Valkey (Managed Database)
We utilize **Vultr Valkey** (Managed Redis-compatible DB) for:
- **Instant Session Recovery**: If a user switches from phone to desktop in the middle of a social crisis, their context is immediately synced.

## 📦 One-Click Deployment on Vultr

Our project is production-ready. You can manifest SentimentSense on Vultr instantly:

```bash
# Clone and Deploy instantly to a Vultr Cloud Compute instance
git clone 
docker-compose up -d
```

## 🎯 Why Vultr?
Vultr provides the **Compute Density** required to run real-time Semantic RAG. Our NumPy vector search is lightning-fast on Vultr’s modern architecture, ensuring that the "Forensic Decision Matrix" is always ready when the user needs it most.
